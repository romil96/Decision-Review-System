# Decision-Review-System

This is a project created in collaboration with one other developer as a part of the completion of my degree at Jagran Lakecity University, Bhopal.

This program allows you to select a video file and play it frame by frame which allows a person to accurately review footage and then give your decision based on the analysis. For example: In the game of cricket, 3rd umpires usually use a similar system. This system is created for reviewing cricket videos but the button names and placement can be changed easily.
